Tested various materials and designs to create a light box that effectively diffused light while maintaining simplicity and ease of assembly. Implemented simplistic remote control functionality with Apple Shortcuts. Consistently shared progress on Instagram and competed in the BuildSpace accelerator program to showcase and refine the work."
